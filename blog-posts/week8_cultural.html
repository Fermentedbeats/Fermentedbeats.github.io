<font size=6>I</font> spent much of my youth avoiding conflict.  Shutting down in the face of a dispute, cheeks flushed, heart palpitating, wanting to run away as fast as I could.  It was through becoming a manager that I had to learn conflict resolution and mediation.  The keys:<br>
<ul>
<li>Calm down.  The response to acute stress happens in the caveman part of your brain which means you're overcome with emotion before the think-y bits of your brain can sort it out.  One technique is to tell yourself the emotion your feeling.  Using language helps jog the rational part of your thinking, allowing you to progress faster.</li>

<li>Listen.  If you're offended, insulted, outraged, whatever, it's really hard to hear the other person.  The quickest way to end an argument is really listen to the other person and ask questions about why they feel the way they do.</li>

<li>Stay resolute.  Yup, people will be disappointed.  Sometimes you need to say no to something someone wants you to do, or hurt someone's feelings, and that's okay.</li></ul><br>

A story.  I recently ended a relationship with a long-term boyfriend.  Fear of the actual break-up conversation lead to a lot of delays on my part.  Far longer than I care to admit.  I desperately did not want to make this guy feel bad - but it had to be done.  I carefully laid out the direction (we need to break up), the expectation (we can be friends, but I need space right now), and the restrictions (not open to negotiation).  In truth I felt terrible, like a monster who crushed someone's dreams.  But the feeling did not last.  In a few days I felt a tremendous wave of relief.  Ripping off the band-aid was not that bad.  It's fear that causes us to hold back on all sorts of things.<br><br><br>

What are you holding back? Tell me below (...once I figure out how the hell to code in a comments box) or send me an <a href="mailto:vitamincjj@gmail.com">email</a>.<br><br><br>
