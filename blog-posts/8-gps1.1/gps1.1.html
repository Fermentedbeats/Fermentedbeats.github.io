            <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
            <p>A technique programmer's use that allows them to switch driver/navigator roles and collaborate on a single project.  Collaborating increases efficiency: it lets programmers see each others' work and help their partner code more effectively.  Two people working at once reduces likelihood of errors and produces better programs.</p>
            <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
            <p>Pair programming is reflective of the conditions you'll find at a lot of tech companies that students may work for one day.  It's also a good educational method - programmers of different experience levels help each other during sessions.  Pairing students allows them to help each other faster and more efficiently than waiting for teacher assistance.</p>
            <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
            <p>The driver is the one typing code while the navigator solves the larger problem, keeping an eye on the big picture.  The driver makes the car move forward, while the navigator uses maps to give instructions to the driver.</p>

            <h3>Pair Reflection</h3>
            <p>I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy pair programming.  With my background in Operations I immediately questioned how productive pair programming would be.  Working alongside someone drastically ups the ante on using time wisely.  In the pair challenge to create this page, we were able to time box accordingly, and execute the core tasks very quickly whereas if I was on my own, I may have gone down the rabbit hole spending excess time tweaking the CSS.  I found it keeps a high level of focus while also reducing errors (two sets of eyes were naturally twice as good for zeroing in on code issues).    </p>
