      <font size=6>W</font>ith a veritable buffet of coding schools available these days, both online and in-person, why Dev Bootcamp? That is...<em> besides</em> the obvious goal of becoming a badass software developer.<br><br>

<ul>
<li><strong>EQ:</strong> Once upon a time, not long ago, I was the worst manager.  Sadly, I was put in charge of 20 people.  I didn't know how to listen, I talked over people, I could not control my emotions, give or take criticism, and I lived on plaset Passive Aggression.  In my earnest hopes to stop being such as asshole I stumbled onto Travis Bradberry &amp; Jean Greaves' book <em>Emotional Intelligence 2.0</em> replete with before &amp; after tests.  I would consider this time "the turning point."  I was thrilled to see the DBC website refer to Chade-Meng Tan's video series on his book <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>, a primer on using Emotional Intelligence to connect and work well with others, find success, and generally get over yourself and get along with those around you.</li>
<li><strong>Yoga:</strong>  I saw a documentary about Yoga several years back called <em>Enlighten Up</em>.  The premise was a woman deeply believing in the life-changing abilities of sustained yoga practice finds a 'normal guy,' and has him do daily yoga and record his experience.  He doesn't become a great lover of yoga, but his life does change and the doc ends with him strengthening his family relationships.  I've had this experience.  At 23, a Bikram yoga studio opened down the block from my apartment in Bridgeport, CT.  They had deals and discounts if you actually showed up every day - so I did.  I spent nearly every night there for 6 months.  Frankly, yoga got really boring: Bikram is the same set of poses every class without deviation. But despite the boredom, something had changed.  The only way I can describe it, is I felt like my brain had been rewired.  All of the sudden I was thinking clearly about my life and what needed to change.  Long story short, I dumped a boyfriend, quit a go-nowhere job, and drove to California.  Since living in California I had one similar experience when I started going to a meditation-night at the since-closed East Bay Meditation center; an experience that caused some deep life reassessment and lead me to check out concepts like EQ.  I "get" DBC's mandatory yoga sessions.  I believe everything ever written about the magic of yoga and meditation to help you live in the now, be more productive, and see the best path to fixing what's wrong.
</li>
<li><strong>DIY: </strong>  As I close on this week's DBC Phase 0 Week 1 challenges I watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's fireside chat</a>, with the message that we are all wholly responsible for our own education.  You get out what you put in, and as much as I wish for a magic pill to swallow that imparts me with awesome coding knowledge (I'm sure Google is working on this), the more I study, without burning myself out, the more I'll learn and one day be able to ultimately give back in the form of building something cool that benefits someone somewhere. </li>
