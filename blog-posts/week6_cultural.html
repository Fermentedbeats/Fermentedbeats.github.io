<font size=6>T</font>his week's cultural assignment focuses on<strong> Stereotype Threat</strong>; the idea that when a group of people are cognizant of a negative stereotype before an event (like taking a test), the stereotyped group tends to fulfill the given stereotype.  This concept has deep undercurrents about why women and minorities are under-represented in the tech industry.<br><br>

From a background in managing people, the concept is not surprising.  My first-hand experience is that people act and react to the way they're treated.<br><br>

My first office job was in a cubicle farm, doing data entry tasks.  I was shocked how much we were treated like animals.  Timed bathroom breaks, weekly review of your computer logs to ensure nothing off-task was done, rigid rules about where to walk, what to wear; the works.  What wasn't as surprising was that the people who worked alongside me, acted out: causing scenes, taking revenge against the managers, all amidst recurring office issues like theft and vandalism.<br><br>

If you treat people like they're terrible children, they act like terrible children.<br><br>

After moving to California and getting a job at a more laid-back start-up I was eerily paranoid about the lack of rules.  I can check my personal email at work?  I can take a break when I want to?  If I'm 30 seconds late just once I don't have to sign a warning notice?  I was happy to see that my fellow employees acted like well-adjusted adults.<br><br>

There's a behavioral psychology theory about employees and their motivation.  Theory X assumes people are self-serving, lazy, and dislike responsibility. The only way a manager can function in this environment is to enact strict rules, punishment, and control to coerce people into producing work.  Theory Y is the opposite; it assumes people want to solve problems and create things, be responsible, and the satisfaction in their job enforces commitment.  Theory Y managers empower employees.<br><br>

We've been raised by teachers and parents who have subtly imparted their own biases.  We operate on our own deeply embedded invisible scripts that influence our capabilities, behaviors, and attitudes.  Stepping out from underneath Stereotype Threat requires a mental vigilance over what biases we have about ourselves, and recognizing what guides the expectations of others coupled with acknowledging their falsehood, and reinforcing your own beliefs.<br><br>
