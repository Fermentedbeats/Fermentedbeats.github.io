		<p>When I was a little kid I have memories of the joy.  Just chilling with my weebles in their playhouse.  Anything was possible.  One time a weeble flew on the wing of a plane.  My dad tried calling me out on it - but fuck that noise - weebles have kung fu grip.  That's what it's like with you.  We do so much cool stuff like order wine in restaurants.  And chase hawks. And go to Alaska one day.  And it's magical.  And I feel the joy.
