		<p>I want the best for you always.  You're so wonderful and I want the universe to reflect that back at you.  That's why next year we're gonna get swole and eat so many vegetables.  When we're chilling in our sweet lake house with Cenzo, Scruffasaurus, and PSL, strolling around in our swimmies, the Mainers will say, "Whaddaya do? That there crossfit, Bub?"<br><br>I think that'd be nice.  I'm old as dirt as excited to settle right into a life writing my novel by the fire on a bearskin rug.  It'll be one of those airport-trash thriller type of novels, but I'll amass a small but loyal following of Midwestern women.
