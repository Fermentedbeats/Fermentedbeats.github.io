		<p>Let's take a break from the feels for a second and just talk about the food. We've made pizzas, squidink, calzones, fajitas, Get Swole Chicken&trade, spring rolls, sushi, oysters, sausage, cheese plates, butter steaks, taco salads, margaritas, hot toddys, ice cream stouts, and Bailey's Xmas disasters. Because of you I've eaten Bahn Mi and Ethiopian food. I also had Philz coffee, and we got you on the Madcap train. I got to read the 40 Hour Kitchen's compendium on urban squab hunting. And holy shit - we've seen some rad shows.  All Them Witches was amazing.  And you played some awesome shows - I'll never forget how I felt when I saw you on stage for the first time.  Or how I almost peed my pants in the middle of Target when you made me laugh super hard.  Or how you wrote me song and how you loved the brass band ensemble I performed for you.
